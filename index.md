If you want to create your own archive of web pages you enjoyed, it can be a list of *cooking recipes*, or a professional *research paper* where you’d want an exact copy and point to that archive online, that’s what this is for.

Refer to [github.com/renoirb/archivator][gh-repo] for the source-code, if you want an example [github.com/renoirb/archivator-demo][gh-demo-repo] (see [renoirb.github.io/archivator-demo][gh-demo-site])
